1. Pineapple.nvim                                   *pineapple-pineapple.nvim*

The ultimate theme manager for neovim


WHY?                                           *pineapple-pineapple.nvim-why?*

The goals of this plugin are:

- Find a theme without using google
- Be able to preview a theme in neovim
- Install a theme and change the colorscheme without touching the config


REQUIREMENTS                           *pineapple-pineapple.nvim-requirements*

- Neovim 0.8.0 or greater


WHAT DOES IT NOT DO             *pineapple-pineapple.nvim-what-does-it-not-do*

Pineapple is not designed to:

- Find a theme that works with treesitter, though you can find some of those themes by a text filter of "treesitter" or "Treesitter"
- Manage the installation for your theme, that is the package manager’s job
- Find a theme for your lualine or anything else that needs to be seperately themed
- Manage any local themes in development you might be using


SETUP                                         *pineapple-pineapple.nvim-setup*

Pineapple has only been tested with lazy.nvim as a package manager, though it
probably would work with others.

Here’s the quick setup:

1. Create an empty file in your ~/.config/nvim/lua/YOUR_LUA_DIRECTORY directory (or C:_if you’re a Windows user) (Called pineapple.lua here). This file is for storing your installed themes.
2. Create an empty file in the ~/.config/nvim/after/plugin folder (called theme.lua). This file is for setting the colorscheme.
3. Then for setup, put this in your config:

>lua
    {
        "CWood-sdf/pineapple",
        dependencies = require("YOUR_LUA_DIRECTORY.pineapple"),
        opts = {
            installedRegistry = "YOUR_LUA_DIRECTORY.pineapple",
            colorschemeFile = "after/plugin/theme.lua"
        },
        cmd = "Pineapple",
    }
<

Note that opts.installedRegistry and colorschemeFile are in different file
formats. This is so that opts.installedRegistry can be put in a variable at the
top of your lazy config file. The directory that both installedRegistry and
colorschemeFile are assumed to be in is $HOME.config(or %USERPROFILE%if
you’re a Windows user)


SETUP OPTIONS ~

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  option              description
  ------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------
  installedRegistry   A lua requireable string that holds the location of the file
                      where the themes to be installed will be stored

  colorschemeFile     A string that holds the location of the file that will be
                      sourced to set the colorscheme
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

USAGE                                         *pineapple-pineapple.nvim-usage*

The plugin can be opened with the command `Pineapple`

All the remaps are shown at the top of the plugin.


SPEED                                         *pineapple-pineapple.nvim-speed*

Pineapple is designed to minimally interrupt your startup time. Nothing is
loaded until the plugin is opened with the command `Pineapple` (at least with
lazy.nvim).


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS                   *pineapple-pineapple.nvim-acknowledgements*

This whole idea is from the vimcolorschemes website
<https://vimcolorschemes.com/>, and I wanted to put that in a neovim extension.

A modified version of the vimcolorschemes worker
<https://github.com/vimcolorschemes/worker> was used to generate the theme
data.


KNOWN ISSUES                           *pineapple-pineapple.nvim-known-issues*

The vimcolorschemes worker has a problem where it incorrectly generates some
themes (I think the ones that only use treesitter), leaving large portions of
the theme as just black


API                                             *pineapple-pineapple.nvim-api*

  Name                      Description

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

UNINSTALL                                 *pineapple-pineapple.nvim-uninstall*

Pineapple is designed to be removed as easily as possible. The steps to remove
it are pretty simple:

Add the installation line for whatever your current theme is to your lazy.nvim
config file. All your downloaded themes can be seen at
~/.config/nvim/YOUR_LUA_DIRECTORY/YOUR_PINEAPPLE_FILE.lua. After this, you can
remove the pineapple install line and run `Lazy sync`.
